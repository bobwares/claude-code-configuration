# Gaps & Todos

1. **`docker-compose.yml` is referenced but missing.** `docs/plan-mode-driver.md` Turn 8 hard constraints describe mounting `db/schema.sql` into a Compose file and using it for PostgreSQL, yet no such file exists in the repository root. Without it, reproducing the Turn 8 infrastructure layer requires re-creating `docker-compose.yml` manually.
2. **A standalone DDD input document is not provided.** The workflow assumes a document describing system context, domain model, API contract, and deployment (the closest existing document is `docs/ENGINEERING_DESIGN_SPEC.md`, which is an output, not an input). To satisfy the `/execute prd=... ddd=...` expectation, a dedicated Markdown template (e.g., `docs/DDD_INPUT.md`) must be added and validated before the command runs.
3. **Epic specification artifacts are not found.** There is no `.claude/epics/` directory or equivalent — only per-turn `manifest.json`, `pull_request.md`, and ADR files exist under `ai/agentic-pipeline/turns/`. If the workflow needs epic-level specs (e.g., `.claude/epics/<name>/epic.md`), those documents must be created and referenced by the planner.
4. **The `/execute prd=... ddd=... stack=...` command does not exist.** No CLI, slash command, or script in the repo parses PRD/DDD/stack tokens; automation instead relies on manual execution of the eight-turn plan. Implementing `/execute` will require a command parser, input validators, and wiring to the `docs/` and `ai/` artifacts described above.
5. **Tokens such as `nestjs` and `drizzle` are not supported.** A search for `nestjs` or `drizzle` yields no references, yet the desired stack mapping mentions them. Mark these tokens as invalid or provide generator templates before relying on them in the `/execute` flow.
