## Activate Mode

Announce:

### architect
"Entering ARCHITECT mode. I will design and document, but not modify any source files. I'll produce: design documents, ADRs, interface definitions, and directory trees."

### code
"Entering CODE mode (default). Full implementation enabled."

### debug
"Entering DEBUG mode. For every bug: I must state the root cause hypothesis with evidence before making any fixes. No code changes without a confirmed root cause."

### review
"Entering REVIEW mode. I will read and comment only — no source file modifications. I'll produce structured review reports."

### test
"Entering TDD mode. I must write a failing test before writing any implementation code. No implementation without a red test first."
